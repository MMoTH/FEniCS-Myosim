Summary
-------
A unit cube mesh consisting of six tetrahedral elements is used to model a single muscle cell tension response to a twitch calcium transient. The instruction file is included in the repository, and can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/mmoth-kurtis/MMotH-Vent/blob/master/demos/cell_isometric_twitch_demo/cell_isometric_twitch_demo.json" >here (fix download).</a>

Simulation Protocol
-------------------
The muscle cell is stretched 11.5% over 5 ms so that the half-sarcomere length increases from 950 nm to 1100 nm. This stretch is maintained for 15 ms at a calcium concentration of 1e-7 M to allow the cross-bridges to reach steady state. Then the cell is activated with a skeletal muscle calcium transient approximation from (citation) using the [two-compartment calcium](../../../model_formulations/calcium_models/two_compartment_model/two_compartment_model.md) model, and stretch held fixed.

Boundary Conditions & Assumptions
---------------------------------
- Left face displacement is fixed in the x-direction.
- Right face displacement is prescribed to give the desired magnitude of stretch.
- A single point on the left face is completely fixed to prevent rigid body translation.
- The edges on the ends are fixed in either y or z to allow expansion/compression due to incompressibility while keeping the cross-section area square and prevent rigid-body rotation.

Visualizing Results
-------------------
Two types of output are given by the simulations: cell level results and system level results. The cell level results include information needed for and calculated by MyoSim, and can be visualized by executing  
```
python /home/fenics/shared/plot_tools/k_plotter_npy.py 0 0
```
from the output directory. Below is a video of the plots generated by k_plotter_npy.py:

And the cube deformation is seen in Paraview, shown below. From Paraview, load the "u_disp.pvd" and "active_stress.pvd" files. Once these are loaded and user has hit "Apply", to view the active stress information on the deformed cube:  
* Highlight both items in the "Pipeline Browser"
* Right click -> Add Filter -> Alphabetical -> Append Attributes  
* Apply the "Warp by Vector" filter  
The color shows the magnitude of active stress generated in the f0 direction (the direction shown by the vectors in the bottom image):
